Problem 5:<br>
(a) Optimal choice: picking the construction M0, M1, M4, M6, with the cost of 4, 5, 2, 3, and the total cost 14.
<br>
(b) Algorithm:<br>
First sort p array in an ascending order, then find the smallest p[i] <= T[N-1], next find the sum of p[i] to p[i+N-1], which will be the minimal cost.
